You wake up in a dark and slightly cold place. As you look around, you notice only a torch by your side. You stand up slowly and, by the faint light generated by the torch, you realize that you are in a dark cave room.

You were running in a forest when you fell into a hole and passed out. After some time, you wake up and look around. Moonlight is coming from the hole you fell through, and there is a lit torch by your side.

You come across an entrance to a cave and, out of curiosity, you decide to enter. As soon as you take a few steps forward into the cave, the entrance crumbles behind you and you realize you cannot leave. Thankfully, you had the foresight to bring a torch.

After a good night in a tavern. You decide to go home and sleep. You were so tired that after lie down in the bed you feel asleep almost imediatly. But as you wake up, you notice sounds drops of water and your bed is not as confortable as it should be. It's like you are sleeping on the ground. As you open your eyes, you see nothing but a torch by your left side and some silhouette of what seems to be rock walls. You slowly get up. There is nothing but you and your torch.
